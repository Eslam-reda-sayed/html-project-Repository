Programming is important to create software and applications that help computer and mobile users in daily life.
You can instruct the computer what to do in areadable form
Allows the programmer to structure the instructions into functions, procedures
This also allows the program to be broken into "chunks" which can be developed by a group of developers

A programming language must be simple,easy to learn and use,have good readability and human recognizable
 Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers.Computer programming languages allow us
 to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands.there are an array of 
 computer programming languagesthat programmers can use to communicate with a computer.
These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information</h2>
