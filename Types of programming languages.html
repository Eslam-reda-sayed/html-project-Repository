<h2>*Computer programming languages ​​allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands.
 , There is a set of computer programming languages ​​that programmers can use to communicate with a computer. 
 These languages ​​allow computers to process large and complex areas of information quickly and efficiently.
 *The most commonly used programming languages
1)   2) Java  3) Javascript  4) C++   5) C#  6) PHP  7) Swift
*Python:is an advanced programming language based on flexible connotations
 NASA uses  Python in its integrated planning system as a text language simple
 to learn and read easily  web  for web development
 Advantages
1-Supports multiple systems and platforms
2-Helps to improve Programmer's Productivity
3-Allows you to scale even the most complex applications with ease
4-Extensive Support Libraries
 *Java :. It is  language for networking, particularly for data centers that store and transfer Web-based data
 Advantages
 Java is used to build applications and platforms for a number of devices, including computers, laptops
 , gaming consoles,  car navigation systems, medical monitoring devices, parking meters,  smartphones.
 *Javascript: Java is used to develop enterprise-wide applications for video games and mobile applications
 as well as to create web-based applications using JSP (Java server pages). When used online
 Java allows small applications to be downloaded
 Ruby is an open-source scripting language that coders can use independently . NASA uses Ruby in its work with simulations.
HTML is used extensively in Web development. HTML is the code that serves as the foundation of Web pages, allowing people to create and structure electronic documents for viewing online.
JavaScript is used by Web developers and software engineers to manipulate page elements to make them more engaging. JavaScript enhances HTML, and it is embedded in most Internet browsers.
C is a middle-level programming language used by software developers and systems analysts. Programmers use C to create applications that integrate with operating systems.
C++,  is another middle-level programming language and works as an extension of C. Programmers use C++ to create games, graphics, and office applications.
C# is a programming language used by software engineers who create applications designed to work with Windows operating systems.

 . Developers use PHP as an open-source language to create dynamic Web pages. Widely used platforms such as WordPress and Drupal work cohesively with PHP.
SQL enables programmers to create, read, update, and delete information in a database. Companies use SQL to gather data.
Apple uses the Swift programming language to create and maintain iOS and OS X applications. Swift 2 is a secondary open-source programming language more recently released by Apple.
